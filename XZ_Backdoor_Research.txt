# XZ Backdoor Research

## Overview
In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". This backdoor allows an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on the affected Linux system. The issue has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number CVE-2024-3094 and has been given a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating the highest severity level.

## Discovery
The backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024. At the time of discovery, the backdoored version had not been widely deployed to production systems but was present in development versions of major Linux distributions.

## Technical Details
The malicious code was added to the xz utility in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. The injection was obfuscated and only included in the full download package, while the Git distribution lacked the M4 macro that triggers the build of the malicious code. The backdoor interferes with SSH authentication via systemd, potentially allowing unauthorized remote access to the system.

## Impact
The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected target as the user running the SSH service. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

## Response
Red Hat issued an urgent security alert for Fedora 41 and Fedora Rawhide users regarding the XZ vulnerability. Debian also released a similar security message. Users are advised to ensure they do not have XZ versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1 on their systems.

## Conclusion
The XZ backdoor represents a significant security risk for Linux systems, particularly those using the affected versions of the xz utility. Users and administrators should take immediate action to mitigate this vulnerability.
